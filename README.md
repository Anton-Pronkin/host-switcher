# Host switcher

## Summary
This is a small extension that helps to quickly switch hosts (and keep other URL parts).
If you have multiple environments or you often use localhost for debugging, this will make it easier!

## Possible features
- Add, remove, update, reorder hosts on the popup.
- Associate each host with a name.
- Save the host configuration to file, load the host configuration from file.
- Conditional hosts (suggest switching to the list of hosts depending on the current host).
